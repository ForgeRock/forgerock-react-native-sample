# ForgeRock React Native Sample Collection

A collection of ForgeRock protected, cross-platform sample apps written with React Native with a supporting (protected) API resource server.

IMPORTANT: This is not a demonstration of React Native itself or instructional for how to build a React Native app. This is intended to demonstrate the implementation of the ForgeRock JavaScript SDK within a React Native app. There are many aspects to routing, state management, tooling and other aspects to building a React Native app that are outside of the scope of this project. For information about creating a React Native app, visit React Native's official documentation.
